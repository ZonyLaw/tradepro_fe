          <ul>
              <li>Never place a large bet overnight, as you tend to get it wrong and lose big, including what you’ve earned—even if it means losing your gains from the day.</li>
              <li>The 4-hour chart shows the extreme points.</li>
              <li>If there is a trend, buy or sell at dips!</li>
              <li>Major mistake is to buy and sell at peaks when you are caught in the moment of loss.</li>
              <li>Ensure that the MACD for both the 1-minute and 5-minute charts is aligned in the same direction.</li>
              <li>Use your risk-averse technique of 0.11, where you take a 0.1 profit when reaching 30% to 50% of 1 pip.</li>
              <li>Some time you may need to treat this one time trade costing £2.50.</li>
              <li>When there is news coming up the first two days will fluctuate so don't place big bets and overnight bets.</li>
