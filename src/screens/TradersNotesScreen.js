      <p><strong>Everyday make sure you prepare your mind mentally! Review below concept please!</strong></p>
      <div>
        <h1>Do's</h1>
           <ul>
              <li>Remember the <strong>climber example</strong> - how much preparation a person goes through before the activity!</li>
              <li>Remember the game about the color box vs. display of color words! Your mind reacts to words faster than the actual colors!</li>
              <li>At extreme points of the bb line, you can risk 50 for a trend trade!</li>
              <li>At extreme points of the bb line, you can risk 120pts for oscilating trade!</li>
              <li>1min and 5min chart can give you a false sense of the bigger picture, so know your facts (e.g. model predictions)</li>
              <li>Each month you can put aside £50 into the account!</li>
              <li>Clear you mind with a blank sheet. Live in the present as news release is done, the important thing is your reaction.</li>
              <li>Thinking differently from the rest of the 90% of the people.</li>
              <li>Review your trade log and aware where you can improve.</li>
              <li>Ask questions about the different scnearios</li>
              <li>When volatility is neutral it means it is perparing for a movement.</li>
              <li>When volatility is pointing opposite to model predicitons, you have to be cautious of taking position suggested by model.</li>
              <li>Your lost or win in the past has nothing to do with the current trade. Live in the present. Know your strategy!</li>
              <li>Peak trend is reached when volatility is above 70 - 80. WAIT for a decrease or put a 100pts above your peak as entry! This is the hardest thing</li>
              <li>When the trend is at peak and you want to continue the trend, you need to pick at least 300 - 400 pts away from the peak!</li>
              <li>When in profit, you should find ways to load up</li>
              <li>When in lost, you should exit quickly given your report suggestion!</li>
              <li>Don't think buying at discount or selling at high values!</li>
              <li>Avoid thoughts of recovery, lost, and bias comments! Think that this is not money you need. You are investing into your future!</li>
              <li>You do not want to spend time staring at charts and hoping it goes your way!</li>

        <h1>Trader's Notes</h1>
          <ul>
              <li>Never place a large bet overnight, as you tend to get it wrong and lose big, including what you’ve earned—even if it means losing your gains from the day.</li>
              <li>The 4-hour chart shows the extreme points.</li>
              <li>If there is a trend, buy or sell at dips!</li>
              <li>Major mistake is to buy and sell at peaks when you are caught in the moment of loss.</li>
              <li>Ensure that the MACD for both the 1-minute and 5-minute charts is aligned in the same direction.</li>
              <li>Use your risk-averse technique of 0.11, where you take a 0.1 profit when reaching 30% to 50% of 1 pip.</li>
              <li>Some time you may need to treat this one time trade costing £2.50.</li>
              <li>When there is news coming up the first two days will fluctuate so don't place big bets and overnight bets.</li>
